# patreon-to-discord-webhooks

Patreon can send you events when someone adds, updates or deletes their pledge to you, I couldn't find anything that can process those. So here's a quick PHP script.

## Setup

1. download script
2. put it somewhere accessible from the web
3. edit script and add your Discord webbhook URL at the top
4. create a [https://www.patreon.com/platform/documentation/clients](Patreon App) 
5. enable all three Patreon webhooks [https://www.patreon.com/platform/documentation/webhooks](here) and point them at the script location
